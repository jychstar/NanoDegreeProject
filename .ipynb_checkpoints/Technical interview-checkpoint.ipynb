    "For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?\n",

    "\n",
    "- For each question, create a solution in Python (version 2). All solutions should be functions named as “question1”, “question2”, et cetera. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed. Code solutions must be in a file called \"solutions.py\".\n",
    "- In the same .py file, include at least 3 test cases for each solution. For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console, like \"print question1()\". On the next line, comment out the output you expect to see from that function call. At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, et cetera.\n",
    "- Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text file (called \"explanations.txt\"). Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.\n",
    "- Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and submit."
