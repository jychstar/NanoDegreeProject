    "# Bay Area Bike Share Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/) is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. You will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. But before you even start looking at data, think about some questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Bay Area Bike Share: what kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Or you might think about if you were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: From business's perspective, I want to know which group of people is my major customer, what is the market size, where should I set the renting stations, what is the reasonable price to attract users, How many bikes should I put in each station.\n",
    "\n",
    "From user's perspective, I want to know whether the shared bike will save me time and money, and whether it feels good to ride.\n"

    "## Using Visualizations to Communicate Findings in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst, the ability to effectively communicate findings is a key part of the job. After all, your best analysis is only as good as your ability to communicate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Bay Area Bike Share held an [Open Data Challenge](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge-2014) to encourage data analysts to create visualizations based on their open data set. You’ll create your own visualizations in this project, but first, take a look at the [submission winner for Best Analysis](http://thfield.github.io/babs/index.html) from Tyler Field. Read through the entire report to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: What visualizations do you think provide the most interesting insights? Are you able to answer either of the questions you identified above based on Tyler’s analysis? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: The most interesting insight is Tyler successfully characterize two groups of users: commuters and tourist. They have quite different bike renting habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "His analysis helped me answer some of my questions, like the major customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem is still the business goal. As far as I know, the renting system is government funded project. It is unclear how to measure the bike sharing has benefit the public transport system. What can we do to make it more cost-efficient?"

    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to explore the data for yourself. Year 1 and Year 2 data from the Bay Area Bike Share's [Open Data](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data) page have already been provided with the project materials; you don't need to download anything extra. The data comes in three parts: the first half of Year 1 (files starting `201402`), the second half of Year 1 (files starting `201408`), and all of Year 2 (files starting `201508`). There are three main datafiles associated with each part: trip data showing information about each trip taken in the system (`*_trip_data.csv`), information about the stations in the system (`*_station_data.csv`), and daily weather data for each city in the system (`*_weather_data.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with a lot of data, it can be useful to start by working with only a sample of the data. This way, it will be much easier to check that our data wrangling steps are working since our code will take less time to complete. Once we are satisfied with the way things are working, we can then set things up to work on the dataset as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bulk of the data is contained in the trip information, we should target looking at a subset of the trip data to help us get our bearings. You'll start by looking at **only the first month of the bike trip data, from 2013-08-29 to 2013-09-30**. The code below will take the data from the first half of the first year, then write the first month's worth of data to an output file. This code exploits the fact that the data is sorted by date (though it should be noted that the first two days are sorted by trip time, rather than being completely chronological).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, load all of the packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis by running the first code cell below. Then, run the second code cell to read a subset of the first trip data file, and write a new file containing just the subset we are initially interested in.\n"

    "In this exploration, we're going to concentrate on factors in the trip data that affect the number of trips that are taken. Let's focus down on a few selected columns: **the trip duration, start time, start terminal, end terminal, and subscription type**. Start time will be divided into year, month, and hour components. We will also add a column for the day of the week and abstract the start and end terminal to be the start and end _city_.\n",

Run the below code cell to see how the station information is structured, then observe how the code will create the station-city mapping. Note that the station mapping is set up as a function, `create_station_mapping()`. Since it is possible that more stations are added or dropped over time, this function will allow us to combine the station information across all three parts of our data when we are ready to explore everything."

In this section we'll walk through some of the things you can do with the functions, and you'll use the functions for yourself in the last part of the project. First, run the following cell to load the data, then use the `usage_stats()` function to see the total number of trips made in the first month of operations, along with some statistics regarding how long trips took."

    "Looks pretty strange, doesn't it? Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. Most rides are expected to be 30 minutes or less, since there are overage charges for taking extra time in a single trip. The first bar spans durations up to about 1000 minutes, or over 16 hours. Based on the statistics we got out of `usage_stats()`, we should have expected some trips with very long durations that bring the average to be so much higher than the median: the plot shows this in a dramatic, but unhelpful way.\n",

    "When exploring the data, you will often need to work with visualization function parameters in order to make the data easier to understand. Here's where the third argument of the `usage_plot()` function comes in. Filters can be set for data points as a list of conditions. Let's start by limiting things to trips of less than 60 minutes."

    "This is looking better! You can see that most trips are indeed less than 30 minutes in length, but there's more that you can do to improve the presentation. Since the minimum duration is not 0, the left hand bar is slighly above 0. We want to be able to tell where there is a clear boundary at 30 minutes, so it will look nicer if we have bin sizes and bin boundaries that correspond to some number of minutes. Fortunately, you can use the optional \"boundary\" and \"bin_width\" parameters to adjust the plot. By setting \"boundary\" to 0, one of the bin edges (in this case the left-most bin) will start at 0 rather than the minimum trip duration. And by setting \"bin_width\" to 5, each bar will count up data points in five-minute intervals."

    "#### Now it's your turn to explore the new dataset with `usage_stats()` and `usage_plot()` and report your findings! Here's a refresher on how to use the `usage_plot()` function:\n",
    "- first argument (required): loaded dataframe from which data will be analyzed.\n",
    "- second argument (required): variable on which trip counts will be divided.\n",
    "- third argument (optional): data filters limiting the data points that will be counted. Filters should be given as a list of conditions, each element should be a string in the following format: `'<field> <op> <value>'` using one of the following operations: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=. Data points must satisfy all conditions to be counted or visualized. For example, `[\"duration < 15\", \"start_city == 'San Francisco'\"]` retains only trips that originated in San Francisco and are less than 15 minutes long.\n",
    "\n",
    "If data is being split on a numeric variable (thus creating a histogram), some additional parameters may be set by keyword.\n",
    "- \"n_bins\" specifies the number of bars in the resultant plot (default is 10).\n",
    "- \"bin_width\" specifies the width of each bar (default divides the range of the data by number of bins). \"n_bins\" and \"bin_width\" cannot be used simultaneously.\n",
    "- \"boundary\" specifies where one of the bar edges will be placed; other bar edges will be placed around that value (this may result in an additional bar being plotted). This argument may be used alongside the \"n_bins\" and \"bin_width\" arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add some customization to the `usage_stats()` function as well. The second argument of the function can be used to set up filter conditions, just like how they are set up in `usage_plot()`."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about our data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the code given. Instead of just looking at number of trips on the outcome axis, you could see what features affect things like trip duration. We also haven't looked at how the weather data ties into bike usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**: Think of a topic or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from your chosen subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: I want to look into the relation between educational level and househeld income level. A very important goal is what is the minimal househeld income to fully support a child's education, how much can government provdie loan or subsidy\n"
